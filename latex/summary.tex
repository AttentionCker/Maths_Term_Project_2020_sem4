{\Huge \textcolor{teal}{Summary}\\}

    In many Engineering problems it is often not feasible to solve a system of linear 
    equations analytically. Hence the use of numerical methods becomes very vital in such scenarios.\vspace{0.5mm}\\ 
    
    This report describes our analysis of the \textbf{\textit{\color{teal} Jacobi Method}}, which is a numerical method to solve 
    a system of linear equations under specific conditions.
